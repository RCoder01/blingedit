BlingEdit v1.0.6 by SethBling, ported to 1.21
===

This has been tested in version 1.21.8, but will likely work with nearby versions too.

Feel free to note bugs in the issue tracker, but I do not guarantee that I will fix them.

All core functionality seems to work (carrot on a stick and sword both work; clone, fill, replace, delete all work). Random has not been tested.
